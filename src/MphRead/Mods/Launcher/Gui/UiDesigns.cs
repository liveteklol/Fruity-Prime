    /// Everything behind the front screen, laid out six ways: `-uidesign DIR`.
    ///
    /// Nothing here ships. It exists because "what should this look like" is a
    /// question nobody can answer from a description, and answering it the
    /// long way round -- build the layout for real, run it, look at it, throw
    /// it away -- is how the last four went.
    ///
    /// **The front screen is not in here.** It is settled and it stays as it
    /// is. What these pictures are about is every screen reached *from* it:
    /// Play with a list of maps and a list of servers, the settings, and the
    /// pause menu. Those are the screens that actually hold something, and the
    /// question they raise is not where to anchor a column of three words --
    /// it is how a list, a picture of the thing selected, a column of settings
    /// about it and a way to commit share one frame.
    ///
    /// So the six differ in **information architecture**, not in where a menu
    /// is pinned. That is the point: moving anchors around produces six
    /// pictures of the same design and there is nothing to choose between them.
    ///
    /// Four things are held constant, because they are what the choice is
    /// *between* rather than part of it:
    ///
    /// - the photograph. Every style is drawn over
    ///   <see cref="UiLayout.Backdrop"/>, and every pause menu over a real
    ///   room with the scrim on top, because a menu photographed against flat
    ///   black is a menu that looks equally readable in all six.
    /// - the content, in full. Twelve maps, five servers with their real
    ///   columns, fourteen settings rows and all eight pause entries, at their
    ///   real heights. A layout that only works with three rows is not a
    ///   layout.
    /// - the palette and the faces, which are <see cref="GuiTheme"/>'s.
    ///   Changing those is a separate question and mixing the two would make
    ///   both unanswerable.
    /// - the two-press rule: a click selects a row, the tick commits. Every
    ///   style has to have somewhere for that tick to live.
    ///
    /// Style A was what shipped when these were drawn, photographed alongside
    /// the rest so there was something to prefer the others to. **F was
    /// chosen**, and the launcher is built around it now
    /// (<see cref="UiLayout.Page"/>) -- so A is a record of what it replaced
