    /// An alt-form gesture, asked for by whipping the mouse. The shared
    /// player consumer maps it to Samus's boost or Spire's alt attack.
    ///
    /// The gesture already exists on the touch head -- a flick on the aim
    /// side boosts, the way a flick of the stylus did on the DS -- and the
    /// desktop has the same free hand: the ball is steered with the roll
    /// binds against the camera's basis and the camera trails it by itself,
    /// so **nothing in <c>ProcessAlt</c> reads a mouse delta at all** for the
    /// four hunters that roll. The hand on the mouse is idle for as long as
    /// the player is a ball, and a boost is the one thing it can be asked for
    /// that costs no bind and collides with nothing.
    ///
    /// **The threshold is a turn, not a distance.** A number of pixels is a
    /// statement about the player's mouse rather than about their hand -- the
    /// same whip is 200 px on one desk and 2000 on the next -- and a fraction
    /// of the window is a statement about their monitor, which has even less
    /// to do with it. What a flick actually is, is "the movement that would
    /// have spun me round if I were on foot", so that is what is measured:
    /// the delta is converted with the game's own aim arithmetic
    /// (<c>delta / 4 * sensitivity</c> degrees) and compared against
    /// <see cref="TurnDegrees"/>. It then self-calibrates to whatever
    /// sensitivity the player already chose, which is the one number in the
    /// program that does describe their hand.
    ///
    /// **What is measured is a straight burst ending on this frame, not the
    /// window's largest displacement.** The first version summed whichever
    /// run of recent frames came out longest, which fires on a hand that
    /// merely wandered a long way and -- worse -- hands back the direction of
    /// that wandering rather than of the whip the player just made. Flicking
    /// down while the sum was still dominated by an earlier upward drift gave
    /// a boost upwards, which is exactly what "the mouse goes down and Samus
    /// still goes up" was. So the burst is grown backwards from the newest
    /// frame and stops at the first sample that is slow (the hand was not
    /// moving yet) or that points somewhere else (<see cref="Coherence"/>):
    /// what it adds up is one movement in one direction, and the direction it
    /// reports is that movement's -- weighted towards the fast part of it,
    /// since the frames a hand spends breaking out of rest point wherever the
    /// wrist was rather than where the player is throwing it.
    ///
    /// **The hand has to come to rest between flicks.** A cooldown alone
    /// still lets one long sweep fire repeatedly, once per cooldown, for as
    /// long as it goes on. A frame slower than <see cref="RestDegrees"/> is
    /// what arms the next one, which also covers the frame a cursor is warped
    /// in -- unpausing, regaining focus -- where the delta is enormous and
    /// means nothing.
    ///
    /// No setting, by design: there is nothing to turn off. The gesture is
    /// only looked for in supported alt forms; holding Samus's boost bind
    /// suppresses it so a flick cannot prematurely release a charge.
