    ///
    ///   * B's screen shows C where the last snapshot put them, which the
    ///     authority composed one downstream trip ago from an intent C sent
    ///     one upstream trip before that.

    ///     later, and the authority spawns the beam against the C it holds
    ///     *now*.
    ///
    /// The two differ by B's full round trip, and it is entirely one-sided: B
    /// aims at a hunter and the shot is resolved against wherever that hunter
    /// walked to in the meantime. At the Pi's 15 ms nobody notices. At 150 ms
    /// a strafing player is most of their own width away from where they are
    /// being shot at, which is the "my shots go through people" report, and
