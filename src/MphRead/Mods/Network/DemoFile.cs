    /// **Frames, not milliseconds.** Version 1 stamped each record with
    /// <c>Environment.TickCount64</c> and the player released them against a
    /// stopwatch. Three things were wrong with that and all three were
    /// visible:
    ///
    /// - The engine's clock is not the wall clock. <c>Renderer</c> advances
    ///   the simulation by a fixed 1/60 s per frame however long the frame
    ///   actually took, so a replay running at 58 fps consumed 60 frames of
    ///   recording every 60 frames and fell behind real time -- and then
    ///   caught up in bursts, several packets landing on one frame. Only the
    ///   newest survives that: <c>RemoteStates</c> and <c>RemoteIntents</c>
    ///   are one slot each, so every position, aim and button level in
    ///   between was dropped on the floor.
    /// - <c>TickCount64</c> ticks every 15.6 ms on Windows. A 60 Hz stream
    ///   stamped on a 64 Hz clock quantises into clumps that drift against
    ///   the frame boundaries, which produced exactly the same bursts on a
    ///   machine holding a perfect 60 fps.
    /// - The stopwatch starts in <see cref="DemoPlayback.Join"/> and the room
    ///   loads after it. Loading takes seconds, nothing is pumped while it
    ///   runs, and the first frame afterwards therefore released every packet
    ///   recorded during it at once -- so a replay opened several seconds in,
    ///   having discarded all but the last of them.
    ///
    /// A frame number has none of those failure modes. The recorder counts
    /// the same frames the simulation does, the player releases one frame's
    /// worth per simulated frame, and the replay reproduces the packet
    /// distribution of the recording exactly, on any machine, at any frame
    /// rate, with any load time in the middle.
    ///
    /// **Deflate.** The stream is dominated by 60 snapshots a second whose
    /// neighbours differ in a few floats, so it compresses better than two to
    /// one -- which is what pays for the authority recording its own outgoing
    /// snapshots (see <see cref="DemoRecorder.RecordOwnSnapshot"/>) without
    /// the file growing. Flushed a few times a second rather than per record:
    /// a sync flush costs a fraction of a percent at that rate and 14% at one
    /// per record, and a quarter second is what a demo that dies with the
    /// game loses.
