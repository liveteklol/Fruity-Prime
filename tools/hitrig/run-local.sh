# The point of the local arm is that the server's own knob (-maxrewind) can be
# moved between runs without a deploy, and the injected latency is a number the
# run chose rather than one the internet is choosing while it is measured. The
# real line is the other arm; this one is where a scenario is proven to work at
# all before it is spent on a 270 ms round trip.
