# replaces FruityPrime.dll while a run is in flight takes every client and the
# server down mid-match -- silently, leaving empty logs and a summary that
# reads as "the scenario produced nothing". Two runs of this rig were lost that
# way before it existed. A staged copy is what makes "build the next arm while
# this one is running" safe, and what makes an arm reproducible afterwards:
# the binary that produced a result is still sitting beside it.
