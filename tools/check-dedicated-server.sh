# Prove the dedicated-server startup contract and the server directory in a
# build actually run.
#
# A standalone dedicated server now runs the match itself. It therefore needs
# the game files, which cannot be put in this public repository or its CI
# artifacts. Publishing something is not enough to prove that contract: the
# binary must fail cleanly, before it can advertise a server which would hand
# the match to a client as the old relay did.
#
# So: start a directory and a standalone server without game files, require
# the server's actionable refusal and exit status, and ensure it never reaches
# the directory. Then query the directory itself. A separate integration run
# with an operator's extracted game files is what exercises an actual match.

#
# The Windows server is the same claim and gets the same check, rather than a
# PowerShell translation of it that would then have to be kept in step. What
# differs there is spelled out where it is handled: the binary is called
# MphReadServer.exe, python3 may only be `python`, and a path this script
# makes has to be converted before it is handed to a .NET process.
