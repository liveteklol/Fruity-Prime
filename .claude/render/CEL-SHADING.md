# Cel shading — the flat colour and the ink line

Two halves, in two different places. `Shaders.FragmentShader` paints every
surface in one flat colour and bands what is left of the shading;
`Shaders.CelFragmentShader` runs over the finished offscreen target and draws
the ink line. `Mods/RenderOptions.cs` holds the three knobs (`CelShading`,
`CelBands`, `CelEdge`) and the launcher's Settings page shows them.

The ES copies of both live in `Mods/Render/EsShaders.cs` and are checked
against the SHA-256 of the desktop source they were written from, so a change
here that is not carried across throws by name at the first compile rather
than rendering differently on a phone. Recompute after editing `Shaders.cs`:
normalise CRLF to LF, hash each `@"..."` body with `""` unescaped.

## Half one: the texture is replaced, not banded

Banding the brightness of a photograph of rubble gives banded rubble. The
mode only started to read as *drawn* when the texture stopped being there at
all:

- `Renderer._flatColors` maps a texture's binding ID to the one colour it
  averages to. It is filled as the texels go to the card -- `BindTexture` and
  `BindGetTexture` are the only places this code ever holds the pixels.
- The average is **weighted by alpha**. A cut-out texture (a grate, a decal, a
  sprite) is mostly transparent and its transparent texels usually carry
  black; averaging those in drags every such surface towards the one colour
  the outline pass needs to keep for itself.
- `Renderer.SetFlatColor` sets `use_flat` and `flat_color` per render item.
  The shader replaces `texcolor.rgb` and **keeps `texcolor.a`**, so alpha
  cut-outs are still cut out and a decal is still shaped.
- `use_pal_override` wins over it: that path is already painting a chosen
  colour, and a flat average on top would lose it.
- HUD models drawn through the scene's program (`SetHudLayerUniforms` -- the
  damage flash, the locator icons, the intro filter) get `use_flat` and
  `cel_bands` set to zero. They are not part of the world. `UpdateUniforms`
  puts the bands back on the next frame.

What is left after that -- the vertex colours, which is where these rooms keep
nearly all of their shading, and the lighting -- is what `cel_shade` bands.
With no texture noise under it the step no longer has to be soft: it is
`smoothstep(0.46, 0.54, ...)` inside a band, wide enough not to crawl as the
camera moves and narrow enough that a band is a band.

## Half two: the ink line, and why it used to be everywhere

**Take the second difference of the raw depth buffer, not of a linearised
distance.** That is the whole fix, and it is one line.

Window-space depth is an affine function of `1/z`, and `1/z` is linear across
the screen for any plane at any angle -- that is what makes perspective-correct
interpolation work. So the second difference of the raw value is *exactly*
zero on a flat surface however steeply it runs away from the camera.

The pass used to linearise to world units first and difference that. `z`
itself is **not** linear in screen space: its second difference across a floor
running to the far wall is large, and it grows with the angle. So every flat
surface seen at a slant -- which is most of a room -- was scribbled over, and
the threshold had to be set so high to hide it that real silhouettes came out
faint. That was the "far too many black lines on flat walls".

The rest is normalisation, so one threshold means one thing everywhere:

| Divide by | Takes out |
|---|---|
| `far/(far-near) - d`, which is `(far*near/(far-near))/z` | how far away the surface is |
| `texel_w` | the resolution: the same corner reads the same at 640x360 and at 4K |

What comes out is about **2 for a right-angled crease** and **hundreds for a
silhouette**. `smoothstep(1.1, 3.5, rel)` is where it sits: sharp creases and
every silhouette, and not the shallow facets of a low-poly cliff, which read
around 0.5 and used to fill Alinos Landfall with a triangle mesh.

Two details that matter:

- **The line's width comes from reach, not from a blur.** `kink_at` is
  evaluated at one texel and at two, each divided by its reach (the second
  difference of a plane is zero at any reach, so both are still clean), and
  the max is taken. A pixel two away from an edge still sees it, so the ink is
  three or four pixels wide instead of the one pixel a drawn line never is.
- **The cleared far plane is skipped** (`d < 0.9999995`). Nothing was drawn
  there, so there is no shape to draw around, and the normalisation would
  divide by nearly zero. The silhouette against it is still found -- from the
  geometry's side, where `d` is finite.

`CelEdge` defaults to **1**, a line of solid black. It was 0.75 back when the
pass inked most of every wall and full strength would have been unreadable.

## Testing it

`-cel on|off`, `-celbands N`, `-celedge N` and `-fog on|off` are read for every
invocation (`ModEntry.ApplyRenderOverrides`), which is what lets a screenshot
command ask for the mode -- the settings file is the launcher's, and
`-thumbnail`, `-maptest` and `-connect` never open one.

```bash
FruityPrime -thumbnail "MP3 PROVING GROUND" -cel on      # one room, into thumbnails/
FruityPrime -thumbnail "UNIT1 ALINOS LANDFALL" -cel on -celbands 5
FruityPrime -netcheck HOST -port N -shots DIR -cel on    # a real match, with hunters
```

Judge it on the desktop. SwiftShader on the emulator draws this scene with
dithered noise through every surface, cel shading on and off alike, so an
Android picture answers "it ran" and nothing about the picture.
