# Launcher — first run and extraction

This file documents the first-run flow and the extraction child process used to unpack a .nds.

- The extraction uses upstream's `Extract.Setup` in a child process: it prints questions and expects stdin answers. The child is run so the GUI does not block on `Console.ReadKey`.
- Consequences:
  - `-launcher` is dispatched before upstream's `CheckSetup` to avoid a "press any key" console stop.
  - `GameFiles.Problem()` signals the rest of the screen whether paths are missing or invalid.

Progress bar

- `SetupProgress` classifies each output line into a phase (writing files, unpacking, converting music, decompressing code) and moves asymptotically within that phase; total is unknown and a counting pass would require reading the cartridge twice.

UI behaviour

- During extraction the progress is drawn in the card; the console draws it with carriage returns only when stdout is a terminal. In a pipe or log the carriage return makes unreadable files.
